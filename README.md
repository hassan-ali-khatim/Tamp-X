# Tamp-X: Attacking Explainable Natural Language Classifiers Through Tampered Activations

This repository is an open source code to (approximately) reproduce the results of our [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404822001857).

Note: Because the XAI methods used in this paper are statistical, the results may be slightly different than as reported in the paper.

# How to run the code?
1. Download and prepare the data in a folder named 'Datasets/' in the parent directory. Example of our folder organization for the AG news dataset: '../Datasets/AG/train.csv' and '../Datasets/AG/test.csv'.
2. Open Attack_XAI.ipynb in the jupyter notebook or VS code.
3. Run the notebook cells.
